YOLOv8 Models:

YOLOv8n (Nano):
Lightweight and fastest.
Suitable for edge devices or applications where speed is critical and computational resources are limited.
Smallest model size.


YOLOv8s (Small):
Balances speed and accuracy.
Ideal for real-time applications with moderate computational resources.


YOLOv8m (Medium):
Offers better accuracy compared to YOLOv8s.
Suitable for more complex scenarios where accuracy is prioritized, but speed is still important.


YOLOv8l (Large):
Larger model with higher accuracy.
Requires more computational resources.
Suitable for applications where accuracy is critical, such as autonomous vehicles or advanced surveillance.


YOLOv8x (Extra Large):
Largest and most accurate model.
Best for scenarios where maximum accuracy is required, and computational resources are not a constraint.
